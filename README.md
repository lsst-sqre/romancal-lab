romancal-lab
============

This is a proof-of-concept implementation for a Phalanx-launchable romancal container to process Roman Space Telescope data.

It is a [Phalanx](https://phalanx.lsst.io)-launchable JupyterLab container, containing the romancal pipeline as the primary kernel, but with JupyterLab machinery in its own Python environment.
